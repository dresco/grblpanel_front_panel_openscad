# OpenSCAD source for a grblPANEL front panel layout

This layout is designed to accomodate the component parts of the
grblPANEL reference design, namely a 3.5" display, 6x11 matrix 
keypad, and quadrature encoders.

It can either be extruded and 3d printed directly, or exported
as a DXF file for import into another process (see PCB based panel
implementation [here](https://github.com/dresco/grblpanel_front_panel)).

It was sized to fit on a typical 3D printer (intial versions were printed
on a Ender3 v2).
